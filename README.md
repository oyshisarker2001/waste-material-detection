 waste-material-detection
using deep learning technology used like yolov8,yolov7,ssd_mobilenet,efficientdetD0

dataset contains overall 212 images with a
total of 20,297 annotations with an average of 97.5 per image across 14 classes namely
board boxes, burnt paper, glass waste, plastic bottles, packets, plastic bags, non-plastic
bottles, paper cups, paper waste, plastic spoons, plastic bowls, plastic plates, and plastic
cups. We divide the dataset into train/validation/test as (93/5/2). The resolution of the input
data is 416x416.
